# Goal: Compare performance of an unsigned shift-and-add multiplier with one using a shift-over technique.

1. Write a program to simulate the process of an n-bit (n  n) shift-and-add syn-
chronous multiplier.
 Use an n-bit RCA for the adding process.
 Assume that the process of a one-bit shift, a multiplexing, and a unit 2-level
logic in the RCA, each takes a delay of 2d.
 Assume that it is synchronized with a clock of a period exactly long enough
for all the delays in one shift-and-add cycle.
 Note: in this part, since it is a synchronous process, there is no need to simulate
the RCA process, but instead to simply account for its worst-case delay.
2. Write a program to simulate the process of an n-bit (n  n) shift-and-add asyn-
chronous multiplier with shift over 0â€™s/1â€™s.
 Fast shift-over-0â€™s/1â€™s is taken, whenever applicable, without the adding process.
That is, a shift-over situation does not incur an adding process. Assume
a delay of 2d for such a case.
 Use a CCA (carry completion adder) of sufficient size for the adder/subtractor
to detect the completion of the adding/subtracting process so as to initiate the
next shift-and-add cycle. Note: you can use either your design from Project#1
or the code provided on the class website.
 Assume that the process of a one-bit shift, a multiplexing, and a unit 2-level
logic in the CCA, each takes a delay of 2d.
 Assume that there is another delay of 2d from the necessary logic for the asynchronous
process to trigger the next cycle.
3. Results required include:
 the program listings for both techniques,
 a plot showing delays of the technique #1 versus n, (8n; 2  n  32, without
using simulation, (Note: Use a log scale for y-axis.)
 From a simulation run of 10,000 times on the technique (2), a plot showing
its performance compared to the results from (1); also a table to show all the
corresponding numbers,
 a demonstration of step-by-step (in delay of 2d) intermediate results for the
second technique for an 12-bit multiplication of x4b7 and x6c9. Clearly indicate
what exactly transpires in each 2d delay.
